# Sapy14 2.0
##Java Implementation of a BASIC-like language interpreter.

**Actually, this is a legacy repo: it contains the whole working code, but the comments and the specification documents must be translated in English first (I'll ASAP do it).**

This is my implementation of a BASIC-like programming language called Sapy, developed during a bachelor-degree programming course. The specifications were almost completely developed, and I will soon complete the work.

This is just a toy! In order to make it an *interesting* toy it's necessary to add more instructions, and thus upgrade all the components. Moreover, this is a raw implementation that must be re-designed to make it become a customizable platform (*Interpreter-as-a-Service*, let's say). I will develop another simple programming language in another repo, taking the best from this one and following this *IaaS* approach.
